*** Interactive evaluation of arbitrary code via ~ghcid~.

- In order to interactively evaluate comments of the following form:

  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- $> code
  #+END_SRC

  Run ~ghcid --allow-eval~ in the root directory. This will automatically reload the file every time it changes, as well as running ~code~ and displaying the result.
